# CHATBOT-WITH-RULE-BASED-RESPONSES
A rule-based chatbot that replies using predefined rules. It checks user messages for keywords like greetings, time, or questions and gives fixed responses. If it doesn’t understand, it shows a default message. It’s a simple project to learn basic conversation flow and pattern matching.
